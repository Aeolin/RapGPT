With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.",

With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.",
