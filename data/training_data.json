With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.\n\nCategory: ",

A value above 80 is good and close to a natural light. This light bulb has an index of 90.\n\nLED light bulbs are available with different colour temperatures that make the light feel more or less warm. This particular light bulb emits a warm-white light (2,700 Kelvin).\n\nThe outer casing is made of durable plastic and can withstand temperatures from -20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C.\n\nIlluminates at full power immediately when you turn the lamp on.\n\nAs the light can be dimmed, you are able to choose lighting suitable for every occasion.\n\nCategory: ",

With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.\n\nCategory: ",

If connected to the IKEA Home smart app, you can also turn the LED light off on the unit when going to sleep.\n\nCategory: ",

With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.\n\nCategory: ",

Just what you need to create a nice, cosy atmosphere in the room.\n\nThe colour rendering index (CRI) of a light bulb defines how well the light reflects true colours. A value above 80 is good and close to a natural light. This light bulb has an index of 90.\n\nLED light bulbs are available with different colour temperatures that make the light feel more or less warm. This particular light bulb emits a warm-white light (2,700 Kelvin).\n\nThe outer casing is made of durable plastic and can withstand temperatures from -20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C.\n\nIlluminates at full power immediately when you turn the lamp on.\n\nAs the light can be dimmed, you are able to choose lighting suitable for every occasion.\n\nCategory: ",

The backrest moves more than the seat when you lean back, so torso\/hips open up. This improves circulation and keeps energy levels up. \n\nAs you recline, the synchronised tilt mechanism allows feet to stay on the floor while your gaze remains straight ahead. Your chest stretches without adding pressure on thighs, improving circulation. \n\nThis swivel chair has adjustable tilt tension that allows you to adjust the resistance to suit your movements and weight.\n\nTo adjust the tilt tension, turn the knob under the seat to increase or decrease the resistance.\n\nThe high backrest and the curved shape of the chair, provide good lower back support and prevent your back from getting tired. You sit comfortably, longer and with a relaxed posture. \n\nThe shape of the armrests provides good support and helps you find a good sitting position.\n\nThe mesh material of the backrest lets air through to your back during long sitting periods.\n\nA safety function locks the castors when no one is sitting in the chair and keeps it securely in place when you stand up.\n\nThe castors are designed to provide ease of movement and maneuverability on both carpeted and hard floors as well as on uneven surfaces. \n\nCategory: ",

Read about the terms in the guarantee brochure.\n\nSuitable for business use.\n\nThis ergonomic office chair has lots of functions that allow you to easily adapt the chair to your body.\n\nHeight-adjustable seat allows you to adjust the height so that back and legs are at a 90\u00b0 angle.  \n\nWith automatic tilt tension, your body weight determines how much resistance the backrest offers. This counter-pressure helps you keep an active posture in your chair.\n\nSynchronised tilt mechanism allows the chair to move with you. The backrest moves more than the seat when you lean back, so torso\/hips open up. This improves circulation and keeps energy levels up. \n\nAs you recline, the synchronised tilt mechanism allows feet to stay on the floor while your gaze remains straight ahead. Your chest stretches without adding pressure on thighs, improving circulation. \n\nThe high backrest and the curved shape of the chair, provide good lower back support and prevent your back from getting tired. You sit comfortably, longer and with a relaxed posture. \n\nIncreased stability since the tilt function is lockable when the backrest is in the upright position. \n\nThe cover is easy to keep clean and fresh, as you can take it off and machine-wash it.\n\nArmrests are available as an extra option to relieve strain on your arms and shoulders.\n\nA safety function locks the castors when no one is sitting in the chair and keeps it securely in place when you stand up.\n\nThe castors are designed to provide ease of movement and maneuverability on both carpeted and hard floors as well as on uneven surfaces. \n\nThe castors are rubber coated to run smoothly on any type of floor.\n\nCategory: ",

Read about the terms in the guarantee brochure.\n\nSuitable for business use.\n\nThe cover is easy to keep clean as it is removable and machine washable.\n\nThis ergonomic office chair has lots of functions that allow you to easily adapt the chair to your body.\n\nHeight-adjustable seat allows you to adjust the height so that back and legs are at a 90\u00b0 angle.  \n\nWith automatic tilt tension, your body weight determines how much resistance the backrest offers. This counter-pressure helps you keep an active posture in your chair.\n\nIncreased stability since the tilt function is lockable when the backrest is in the upright position. \n\nSynchronised tilt mechanism allows the chair to move with you. The backrest moves more than the seat when you lean back, so torso\/hips open up. This improves circulation and keeps energy levels up. \n\nAs you recline, the synchronised tilt mechanism allows feet to stay on the floor while your gaze remains straight ahead. Your chest stretches without adding pressure on thighs, improving circulation. \n\nThe high backrest and the curved shape of the chair, provide good lower back support and prevent your back from getting tired. You sit comfortably, longer and with a relaxed posture. \n\nArmrests provide support for the upper part of your forearms and reduce strain on the back and shoulders during long meetings.  \n\nA safety function locks the castors when no one is sitting in the chair and keeps it securely in place when you stand up.\n\nThe castors are designed to provide ease of movement and maneuverability on both carpeted and hard floors as well as on uneven surfaces. \n\nThe castors are rubber coated to run smoothly on any type of floor.\n\nCategory: ",

Cold colours like blue have the opposite effect.\n\nTo prevent your child from waking up when the lamp turns off, the light dims slowly during the last 15 minutes.\n\nThe bulb has a lifetime of around 25,000 hours. This corresponds to approximately 8 years if the lamp is on for 8 hours per night.\n\nCategory: ",
