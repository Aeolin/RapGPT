With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.",

They all make your child relax and fall asleep calmly.\n\nLight in warm colours like red and orange makes the body produce the hormone melatonin, which causes us to relax and get sleepy. Cold colours like blue have the opposite effect.\n\nTo prevent your child from waking up when the lamp turns off, the light dims slowly during the last 15 minutes.\n\nThe bulb has a lifetime of around 25,000 hours. This corresponds to approximately 8 years if the lamp is on for 8 hours per night.",

This particular light bulb emits a warm-white light (2,700 Kelvin).\n\nThe outer casing is made of durable plastic and can withstand temperatures from -20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C.\n\nIlluminates at full power immediately when you turn the lamp on.\n\nAs the light can be dimmed, you are able to choose lighting suitable for every occasion.",

With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.",

With built-in tech that melts into your decor, sometimes you can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s smart!\n\nAll our smart products work independently. Adding them to the hub opens up new ways to control and customise your home \u2013 with extra functions and features when you combine two or more products.\n\nYour smart home can be controlled in various ways \u2013 with the IKEA Home smart app, remote controls, shortcut button, voice or motion. You control individual products, groups, rooms or all at once.\n\nWhen it comes to control, we think of everyone \u2013 young, old and guests. While the app gives you control to customise your smart home, our remotes make it easy for everyone else to use it as well.\n\nFound the perfect combination of cosy lighting and music? Save it as a 'Scene' in the app! By creating your own scenes, the right mood for any occasion is just a tap away.\n\nTrigger scenes with schedules or manually with a shortcut button or the app, for example when you want to turn off all lights and other smart products with a single press when leaving home in the morning.\n\nScenes can also be used to schedule lights to be turned on when you're away, for the air purifier to clean the air before bedtime, or for the blinds to roll down to prevent indoor heat from the sun.\n\nWith the hub, it\u2019s easy to expand your smart home over time as we continuously grow our range of smart products. Why not start with the rooms where you spend most time, and explore smart lighting?\n\nWe continuously update the IKEA Home smart app with new and improved features for an even more fun and convenient way to use your smart home.",

    "Description": "LED light bulbs are both energy efficient and long-lasting, with a lifetime of approximately 25,000 hours \u2013 two benefits that allow you to save money on both bulb replacements and electricity.\n\nThis LED light bulb spreads the same warm light as a traditional 75W light bulb \u2013 without flickering or emitting any sound. Just what you need to create a nice, cosy atmosphere in the room.\n\nThe colour rendering index (CRI) of a light bulb defines how well the light reflects true colours. A value above 80 is good and close to a natural light. This light bulb has an index of 90.\n\nLED light bulbs are available with different colour temperatures that make the light feel more or less warm. This particular light bulb emits a warm-white light (2,700 Kelvin).\n\nThe outer casing is made of durable plastic and can withstand temperatures from -20\u00b0C to +40\u00b0C.\n\nIlluminates at full power immediately when you turn the lamp on.\n\nAs the light can be dimmed, you are able to choose lighting suitable for every occasion.",

You sit comfortably, longer and with a relaxed posture. \n\nThe shape of the armrests provides good support and helps you find a good sitting position.\n\nThe mesh material of the backrest lets air through to your back during long sitting periods.\n\nA safety function locks the castors when no one is sitting in the chair and keeps it securely in place when you stand up.\n\nThe castors are designed to provide ease of movement and maneuverability on both carpeted and hard floors as well as on uneven surfaces.

    "Description": "By keeping an eye on things as harmful particles, temperature, humidity and volatile organic compounds you can affect the air quality at home and also help prevent for example mold and mildew growth.\n\nThe air purifier can be set to auto mode, which means that it automatically detects the particles (PM2.5) in the air and then adjusts the fan speed, so you can think about other things. \n\nUpgrade your STARKVIND air purifier(s) by adding this sensor that offers more precise air quality measurements and can be placed in a central location in the room, away from the purifier.\n\nThis sensor checks the air quality by monitoring harmful particles (PM2.5), temperature, relative humidity and total Volatile Organic Compounds (tVOC) in your home. \n\nThe arrow shows if the level of tVOC is increasing, decreasing or is stable. tVOC stands for total volatile organic compounds from, for example, paint, cooking or cleaning and household products. \n\nWith a smart home from IKEA, it's easy to create smarter everyday moments with lighting, speakers, blinds and air quality products.\n\nYou can sleep with the air purifier on since it is very quiet at the lower fan speeds. If connected to the IKEA Home smart app, you can also turn the LED light off on the unit when going to sleep.",
