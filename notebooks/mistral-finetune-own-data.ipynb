    "# Fine-tuning Mistral on your own data 🤙\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and tutorial, we will fine-tune the [Mistral 7B](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src) model - which outperforms Llama 2 13B on all tested benchmarks - ***on your own data!***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Watch the accompanying video walk-through [here](https://youtu.be/kmkcNVvEz-k?si=Ogt1wRFNqYI6zXfw&t=1)!\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this for **just one dollar ($1)** on an 1x A10G 24GB from Brev.dev (instructions below).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use QLoRA, a fine-tuning method that combines quantization and LoRA. For more information about what those are and how they work, see [this post](https://brev.dev/blog/how-qlora-works).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will load the large model in 4bit using `bitsandbytes` and use LoRA to train using the PEFT library from Hugging Face 🤗.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you ever have trouble importing something from Huggingface, you may need to run `huggingface-cli login` in a shell. To open a shell in Jupyter Lab, click on 'Launcher' (or the '+' if it's not there) next to the notebook tab at the top of the screen. Under \"Other\", click \"Terminal\" and then run the command.\n",

I will help guide you through that in this guide, and if you have any additional questions you can reach out on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/RN2a436M73) or on [X](https://x.com/harperscarroll).\n",

Then find the process ID `PID` under `Processes` and run the command `kill [PID]`. You will need to re-start your notebook from the beginning. (There may be a better way to do this... if so please do let me know!)"

    "\n",
    "I used Exporter, a free local-only app, to export my Apple Notes to `.txt` files, and then I wrote a script to process each note into one `.jsonl` file. Note that for this script, ChatGPT can help out a LOT if you tell it how your data is currently formatted, how you'd like it to be formatted, and ask it to write a script in a certain language you know well (for any debugging) to do so. I also broke up my journal entries so the training sample vector length was smaller (see the discussion on `max_length` and the data visualization below). I broke it into pieces so that contexts were encapsulated entirely, since I did want the model to understand context about my life. My data were ultimately formatted as:\n",

There is where you'll find a sweet spot for how many steps to perform. For example, say you start with 1000 steps, and find that at around 500 steps the model starts overfitting, as described above.
